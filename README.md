# ♻️ PickMyScrap

**Direct Scrap Trading. Zero Middlemen. 100% Transparency.**

PickMyScrap is a full-stack **peer-to-peer scrap trading platform** that connects sellers and buyers directly. It enables users to list household scrap items (like metals, plastics, electronics, books, etc.) and allows buyers to browse and instantly accept listings. Once an item is accepted, it’s removed immediately — ensuring fairness and first-come, first-serve transparency. ([GitHub][1])
